# Data Structures & Algorithms

Goals:
- Learn a low level language like C to increase my knowledge of what the computer is doing
- Learn Data Structures & Algorithms so that I can have good fundamentals

## Personal TO-DO list
- Implement an array based stack
- Clean up linked list code
- Write the factorial function in the recursion section


## Maybe in the future TO-DO list
- Implement a linked list based stack
- Implement a dynamic with arrays stack
